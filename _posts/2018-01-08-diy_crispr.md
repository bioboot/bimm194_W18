 With do-it-yourself Crispr kits now available online. Is it really possible to edit your own DNA, is it safe and how should it be regulated?

In October, biohacker [Josiah Zayner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Zayner) gave a [lecture in San Francisco](http://www.ifyoudontknownowyaknow.com/2017/10/the-first-human-to-attempt-crispr-gene.html) in which he claimed to be the first person known to have edited his own DNA using **CRISPR** technology. He insists it’s something anyone can do using one of his company’s gene engineering kits. But does this do-it-yourself approach have any evidence to back it up? Is it safe? And, ultimately, does this kind of self-experimentation drive science forward or expose the public to unacceptable risks?


#### Where do you stand?
