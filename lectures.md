| 2 | Fri, 01/19/18 | [**Genomics and cancer treatment**]({{ site.baseurl }}/class-material/Lecture02_BIMM194_W18.pdf) <br> What is cancer and how does it arise? Example genes implicated in cancer. What has been learned from genome sequencing of cancer? How can sequencing advance cancer treatment? Why do some anticancer drugs fail and how might genomic approaches help address the issue? Can genomic approaches help detect early cancer and monitor treatment effectiveness? What is immunotherapy? Can genomics be used to harness a patient’s own immune system to fight cancer?  <br> [Slides]({{ site.baseurl }}/class-material/Lecture02_BIMM194_W18.pdf),  [Readings]({{ site.baseurl }}/readings/),  [Notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/class-material/Lecture2_notes.pdf) |

| 3 | Fri, 01/26/18 | [**Recent advances in genomic technologies and their clinical applications**]({{ site.baseurl }}/class-material/Lecture03_BIMM194_W18.pdf) <br> How are genomic technologies currently impacting the practice of medicine? What recent and future advances in genomic technologies have the potential for major clinical impact? What other ‘omes’ are useful for medicine? Can the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome be useful? How deeply can a person be analyzed? The promise and hype of personalized medicine. Open discussion of how genomics can inform on disease risks and some of the challenges associated with the use and management of genomic and related health information. We will also learn about the 100,000 Genome project and where genomic medicine could take us next. <br> [Slides]({{ site.baseurl }}/class-material/Lecture03_BIMM194_W18.pdf),  [Reading](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09764) |
